# OptiCode-AI
OptiCode AI – Live Code Analyzer and Optimizer
OptiCode AI is an advanced code analysis and optimization tool powered by our proprietary Large Language Model (LLM). It assists developers in real-time by providing insightful feedback, detecting code quality issues, and suggesting optimizations to enhance performance and maintainability.​

Features
Real-Time Code Analysis: Receive immediate feedback on your code as you write, helping you catch issues early in the development process.​

Syntax and Style Checking: Identify syntax errors and enforce consistent coding styles to maintain code quality.​

Performance Optimization: Detect performance bottlenecks and receive suggestions to optimize your code for better efficiency.​

Security Vulnerability Detection: Uncover potential security risks within your codebase to ensure robust and secure applications.​

Multi-Language Support: Analyze and optimize code written in various programming languages, making it versatile for diverse projects.​

Tech Stack

Python: Primary language for core logic, system management, and integrations.

Flask: Lightweight web framework for the user interface and API.

psutil: Library for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory).

Pygments: Syntax highlighter for code snippets in the UI.

LLMs: Language model for generating optimization suggestion and code.
